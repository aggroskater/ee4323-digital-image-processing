===============================

Digital Image Processing with MATLAB. Taken with Dr. Stapleton during the 
Fall of 2013. 

I'd prefer to learn how to do all this with a more proper graphics API.
However, I'm taking four different classes right now. One is very C-heavy 
already (Computer Architecture). Another has a few C projects (Operating 
Systems). As well, my senior design course takes enough of its own coding 
time when interfacing the RNG with the USB host. AND I'm learning how to use 
Microwind and LT-Spice in my VLSI class.

tl;dr - I'm too damn busy. MATLAB will suffice for now.
